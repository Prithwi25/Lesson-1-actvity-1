                    <p><h3>Football: What Is It?
                    More than ninety minutes have elapsed. It is the deafening roar of the crowd, the brutal crash of<br> cleats meeting, the tense silence before a penalty kick, and the spinning instant when the ball <br>smashes into the net.
                    
                    Football, or as others would prefer to address it, is the world's game. It is a simple game with an <br>endless supply of tales, played in backyards and massive stadiums, from small towns to the<br> largest World Cups.
                    
                    One ball.
                    Two goals.
                    Millions of dreams.
                    
                    How Football Works: 11 vs. 11: Two sides face off, both trying to score more than the other.
                    
                    90 minutes: The game is split into two halves of 45 minutes, broken in the middle by a panting <br>halftime break.
                    
                    Use Your Feet: Goalkeepers excepted, there is no penalty for using hands, but only within their own box.
                    
                    Offside Rule: You can't just stand around and grab an easy goal by being behind defenders.

                    Unfair tackles are punished by free kicks or penalties, keeping thegame level and exciting.</h3></p>
